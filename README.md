This is an automated system for a library which performs different functionalities such as storing user info, branch info, book info, borrowing etc. With the help of the distributed database we can easily find the information about a 
particular book or student of different branches.  Depending on this management system many activities can be performed like notifying users about new books or validations dates or new branch opening through email or phone etc.
